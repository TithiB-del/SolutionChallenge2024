# Details
<p>Every year in the winters, Stray (assuming dogs mainly-coz I have seen puppies in distress) animals are left with no care, out in the cold roads in freezing temperatures, with very little food & hospitality available for them.</p>
<p> Many a times, it can be seen that young puppies roaming around places where they shouldn't be, just because their mother/sibling died in front of them. </p><p>Mostly by runovers by vehicles.
<p>This is to get news of distressed animals & transfer them in safe hands or to raise funds for their well-being or even adoption-they too deserve love & care!</p>

# Please clearly describe the challenge you are solving through this project.
<p>Solving the problem of too many stray dogs, left with no care.<br>
Even some NGOs' help is not sufficient enough to create a sustainable solution to these poor animals, with less proper vaccination, all almost famished, which can explain why a lot of them contract deadly diseases.</p>
<p> If there was a system which allowed the stray animals to get proper care, nutrition or even a home, a lot of people would be benefitted from it, as well as the pets themselves.<br>
A large chunk of the people have the opportunity to feed them, but not necessarily, house them or pay for the expenses of vaccination/diseases; 7 are completely helpless when they contract a fatal disease & need further medical intervention.</p>

# Please describe your project's impact using cause and effect. How does your solution address the problem you are looking to solve? How were some of the goals of your solution evidenced? What was the quantifiable data collected? What tools did you use to help understand your solution's impact?
<p>My solution addresses the problem of stray animals, getting no proper care & environment.
If stray animal management is done well, there would be fewer cases of getting bitten by stray animals, & increase in the total number of affordable and domesticated, indigenous pets which could change the economy if implemented properly.
