# Details
<p>Every year in the winters, Stray (assuming dogs mainly-coz I have seen puppies in distress) animals are left with no care, out in the cold roads in freezing temperatures, with very little food & hospitality available for them.</p>
<p> Many a times, it can be seen that young puppies roaming around places where they shouldn't be, just because their mother/sibling died in front of them. </p><p>Mostly by runovers by vehicles.
<p>This is to get news of distressed animals & transfer them in safe hands or to raise funds for their well-being or even adoption-they too deserve love & care!</p>

# Please clearly describe the challenge you are solving through this project.
<p>Solving the problem of too many stray dogs, left with no care.<br>
Even some NGOs' help is not sufficient enough to create a sustainable solution to these poor animals, with less proper vaccination, all almost famished, which can explain why a lot of them contract deadly diseases.</p>
<p> If there was a system which allowed the stray animals to get proper care, nutrition or even a home, a lot of people would be benefitted from it, as well as the pets themselves.<br>
A large chunk of the people have the opportunity to feed them, but not necessarily, house them or pay for the expenses of vaccination/diseases; 7 are completely helpless when they contract a fatal disease & need further medical intervention.</p>

# Please describe your project's impact using cause and effect. How does your solution address the problem you are looking to solve? How were some of the goals of your solution evidenced? What was the quantifiable data collected? What tools did you use to help understand your solution's impact?
<p>My solution addresses the problem of stray animals, getting no proper care & environment.
If stray animal management is done well, there would be fewer cases of getting bitten by stray animals, & increase in the total number of affordable and domesticated, indigenous pets which could change the economy if implemented properly.

# What United Nations' Sustainable Development goal(s) AND target(s) did you choose for your solution? What inspired you to select these specific goal(s) AND target(s)?

<p>The effective management of the issues aimed to be solved by the project can actually lead to the fulfillment of the above goals, namely, Sustainable Cities and Communities; Responsible Consumption and Production.</p>


# Please specify what kind of help you need help in your project? 
<p>Technical, Guidance on the future of the project, & whether it can be migrated into an entreprenaurial venture.</p>

# Describe the architecture that your team chose for your solution. What are the high-level components of your architecture? What is the responsibility of each component?
<p>Apparently, a website, with plain HTML & CSS.<br>
I have plans to build a detailed website, which will serve as a point of information as well as a point to communicate important information, like 
<ul>
<li>Report an incident to report an incident like a particular stray is in severe distress, needing immediate help</li>
<li>Find Vets nearby for the strays incase they fall sick & are abandoned</li>
<li>Contact Emergency Services incase any stray has gone rabid 7 is attacking people</li>
<li>Raise Funds for our furry friends' wellbeing on behalf of NGOs</li>
<li>Update Information on rescued strays so that the people who reported their distress are lauded for their efforts</li>
<li>Donate/Organise events for straysâ€™ wellbeing like camps</li>
<li>Upload Pictures or Videos of Animal abuse/stray in need of immediate help to help citizens upload genuine proof that something needs immediate intervention</li>
<li>Find foster care nearby for people who might wanna give up previously owned pets</li>
<li>Appeal for Adoption get new but previously owned pets</li>

# Which specific products and platforms did you choose to implement these components and why?
<p>Google cloud for web hosting, github to store code, I plan to migrate it to kotlin & use kotlin multiplatform once my examinations are over. The prototype was made in Figma.

# Highlight one challenge you faced while building your code, including detail on how you addressed the issue and the technical decisions and implementations you had to make.
<p>Time management, brainstorming for a good idea.
Had end Semester exams in the mix, so had to improvise a lot & come up with the details within a very short while. Hope that the content was put well together!</p>

# Any others challenges you want to highlight from you project?
<p>Implementation of all the features, which can be quite challenging & overwhelming at the same time.

# What do you see as the future / next steps for your project? How would you expand your solution to reach a larger audience?
<p>Bringing the website to a finished stage, working on user management system, getting in touch with collaborators,testers &, of course,users to make it happen!

# How do you plan to scale your project further in terms of project features?
<p>I plan to rscale out all the features on a rolling basis. at first, limited features will be available but might scale it up to all of the features if required, with time.
